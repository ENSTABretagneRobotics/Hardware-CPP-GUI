Hardware-CPP-GUI
================
The purpose of this project is to be able to quickly test with a simple GUI the devices available in https://github.com/ENSTABretagneRobotics/Hardware-CPP, since text-only display might not be useful for some devices such as lidars.

This a CMake project and OpenCV library needs to be installed, see e.g. https://www.ensta-bretagne.fr/lebars/tutorials/ .
